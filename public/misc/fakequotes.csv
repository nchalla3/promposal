So strawberries are recyclable. Yes. What?
It's not because I'm white I swear I'm not that white
Woo woo it's just she herself and why
I'm finding my mind
I'm the dumbest EVERRRR
"Um, ah, um, oh"
Im gonna laugh
Im allowed to live forever
You're allowed to hang out normally
My brain is working perfectly
I am the smartest person alive
I love when you explain things to me
That's boring
That's sad
Spain is in South America
I'm gonna hug you aggressively
Have I emptied my wa-uhh-ha <while filling said water bottle>
Ow, my neck. Why am I saying that it actually hurts?
If you get too far you're going to understand
My balls are so big and juicy
He's not a robot he's a human being
I'm gonna stab him, with a knife
If you speak then you say words
I was like who is this diva
Filmbros are just worse theatre kids
We have to make sure everything is clear
No it's like all perfectly pronounced
You have to guess otherwise you're fired
So they're like black and then they're like normal
One of my kids basically flew
Yes, no, what the huhhhhh
It's like high-fiving but it's your elbow
Can you-can you-yes
She has seen me do a lot of interesting things
"I'm going to punch her; I'm going to do it"
"You, my mom, and my mother"
These cats are meant to fly
The Mormon was not very Mormon-y
I punched you because it's funny
