Im gonna laugh,

You're allowed to hang out normally,

I'm gonna hug you,
Have I emptied my wa-uhh-ha <while filling said water bottle>,
"Ow, my neck. Why am I saying that it actually hurts?",
Having/making incoherent sentences,
<intelligible noise>,
If you get too far you're going to understand,
She just…SHHH <sits down quietly>,

You're helping this man's life,
If you speak clearly and concisely,

"Yes, no, wait, what happened",
It's like high-fiving but it's your elbow,

"It's like firsthand pride, but it's you, so it's amazing",
"You, my mom, and my mother",
These cats are meant to fly,
"So she has a girlfriend, who she will date",
I'm entering my brain zone calmly
